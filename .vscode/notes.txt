Make the butterfly fly towards the edge of the screen the same way its wandering around to the words.

Make the butterfly scared of the mouse

Make me able to catch the butterfly with the mouse if i go fast enough with the mouse. 

Add more randomness in the butterfly movement. two butterfly should never be synced.

Make it sit on a random spot on the word.
